Why did the number 7 eat the number 9? Because it was feeling a little odd! And speaking of odd, did you know that the number 37 is the smallest prime number with both its digits as prime? But wait, there's more! The number 42 is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything according to Douglas Adams' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." And if you thought those were impressive, just wait until you hear about the number 69...but I'm afraid I can't say that here, it's a family-friendly text after all! (c) chatGPT
